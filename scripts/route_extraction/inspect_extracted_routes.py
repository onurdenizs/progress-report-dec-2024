"""
inspect_extracted_routes.py

Inspect extracted GTFS route-stop sequences and enrich with stop names.

This script loads route-stop sequences extracted from stop_times.txt and trips.txt,
joins stop IDs with human-readable stop names from stops.txt, and saves a preview
for inspection and further analysis.

Usage:
    Run this script after `extract_routes_from_gtfs.py` to verify extracted routes.
